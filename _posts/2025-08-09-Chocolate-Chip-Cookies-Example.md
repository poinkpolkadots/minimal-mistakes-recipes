*With 22 million page views and counting since 2013, these super **soft and chewy chocolate chip cookies** are the most popular cookie recipe on my website. Melted butter, more brown sugar than white sugar, cornstarch, and an extra egg yolk guarantee the absolute chewiest chocolate chip cookie texture. And you don’t even need a mixer!*

***I originally published this recipe in 2013** and have since added new photos, a video tutorial, and more helpful success tips.*

There are thousands of chocolate chip cookies recipes out there. Everyone has their favorite and this one is mine. Just a glance at the *hundreds* of reviews in the comments section tells me that this recipe is a favorite for many others too! In fact, if you asked me which recipe to keep in your apron pocket, my answer would be this one. (In addition to a classic cut-out **sugar cookies** and flaky **pie crust**, of course!) Just read the comments on a **post in our Facebook group**. These cookies are beloved… and, a warning: they disappear FAST.

This recipe is such a fan (and personal) favorite that I included it in my new cookbook, Sally’s Baking 101.

**Why Are These My BEST Chocolate Chip Cookies?**

- The chewiest of chewy and the softest of soft.
- Extra thick just like my favorite **peanut butter cookies**!
- Bakery-style BIG.
- Exploding with chocolate.

I’ve tested this cookie recipe over and over again to make sure they’re absolutely perfect. I still have a big space in my heart (and stomach) for these **soft chocolate chip cookies**. Today’s recipe is similar, but I increased the chewiness factor.

You can make them with chocolate chips or chocolate chunks.

**Key Ingredients for Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies**

The cookie dough is made from your standard cookie ingredients: flour, leavener, salt, sugar, butter, egg, and vanilla. It’s the *ratios and temperature* of those ingredients that make this recipe stand out from the rest. 

- **Melted butter:** Melted butter produces the chewiest cookies. It can, however, make your baked cookies greasy, so I made sure there is enough flour to counteract that. And using melted butter is also the reason you don’t need a mixer to make these cookies, just like these **pumpkin chocolate chip cookies** and **M&M cookie bars**.
- **More brown sugar than white sugar:** More brown sugar than white sugar: The moisture in brown sugar promises an extra soft and chewy baked cookie. White granulated sugar is still necessary, though. It’s dry and helps the cookies spread. A little bit of spread is a good thing.
- **Cornstarch:** Why? Cornstarch gives the cookies that ultra soft consistency we all love. Plus, it helps keep the cookies beautifully thick. We use the same trick when making **shortbread cookies**.
- **Egg yolk:** Another way to promise a super chewy chocolate chip cookie is to use an extra egg yolk. The extra egg yolk adds richness, soft tenderness, and binds the dough. You will need 1 egg + 1 egg yolk, at room temperature. See the recipe Notes for how to bring your eggs to room temperature quickly.

The dough will be soft and the chocolate chips may not stick because of the melted butter. Just keep stirring it; I promise it will come together. Because of the melted butter and extra egg yolk, the slick dough doesn’t even look like normal cookie dough! Trust the process…

The most important step is next.

**2 Major Success Tips**

1. **Chill the dough.** Chilling the cookie dough is so important in this recipe! Unless you want the cookies to spread into a massive cookie puddle, chilling the dough is mandatory here. It allows the ingredients to settle together after the mixing stage but most importantly: cold dough results in thicker cookies. Cover the cookie dough and chill for at least 2–3 hours or up to 3 days. I usually chill it overnight.

(**No time to chill?** Make these soft & chewy **chocolate chip cookie bars**, **giant chocolate chip cookies**, **chocolate chip cookie cake**, or crispy **chocolate chip cookie bark** instead!)

2. **Roll the cookie dough balls extra tall.** After the dough has chilled, scoop out a ball of dough that’s 3 Tablespoons for XL cookies or about 2 heaping Tablespoons (1.75 ounces or 50g) for medium-large cookies. I usually use **this medium cookie scoop** and make it a heaping scoop. But making the cookie dough balls tall and textured, rather than wide and smooth, is my tried-and-true trick that results in thick and textured-looking cookies. We’re talking thick bakery-style cookies with wrinkly, textured tops. Your cookie dough should **look less like balls and more like, well, lumpy columns**, LOL.

Watch the **video below** to see how I shape them. I also demonstrate how I use a spoon to reshape them during baking if I see they’re spreading too much.
