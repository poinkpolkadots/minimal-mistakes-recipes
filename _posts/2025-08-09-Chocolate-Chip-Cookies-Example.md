*With 22 million page views and counting since 2013, these super **soft and chewy chocolate chip cookies** are the most popular cookie recipe on my website. Melted butter, more brown sugar than white sugar, cornstarch, and an extra egg yolk guarantee the absolute chewiest chocolate chip cookie texture. And you donâ€™t even need a mixer!*

***I originally published this recipe in 2013** and have since added new photos, a video tutorial, and more helpful success tips.*
